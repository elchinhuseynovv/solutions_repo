### Algorithm Description for Equivalent Resistance Using Graph Theory

The algorithm works by iteratively simplifying the circuit (represented as a graph) by identifying series and parallel resistor combinations and replacing them with their equivalent resistances until only a single equivalent resistance remains between the source and target nodes.

#### Key Steps:
1. **Graph Representation**: Represent the circuit as an undirected weighted graph where:
   - Nodes represent junctions (connection points).
   - Edges represent resistors, with edge weights equal to their resistance values.
   - Multiple edges between the same nodes represent parallel resistors.

2. **Series Reduction**:
   - Two resistors are in series if they share a node of degree 2 (i.e., no other resistor is connected to that node).
   - Replace series resistors with a single resistor of value $R_1 + R_2$.

3. **Parallel Reduction**:
   - Two resistors are in parallel if they share the same two nodes.
   - Replace parallel resistors with a single resistor of value $\frac{1}{\frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2}}$.

4. **Iterative Simplification**:
   - Repeatedly apply series and parallel reductions until no further simplifications are possible.
   - If the graph reduces to a single edge between the source and target nodes, its weight is the equivalent resistance.
   - If the graph cannot be fully simplified (e.g., due to a bridge or complex topology), additional methods like the Laplacian matrix approach may be needed (not covered here).

### Pseudocode

```python
function equivalent_resistance(graph, source, target):
    while graph has more than one edge between source and target or reducible nodes:
        # Step 1: Parallel Reduction
        for all pairs of nodes (u, v):
            if there are multiple edges between u and v:
                replace all parallel edges between u and v with a single edge of equivalent parallel resistance
                update graph
        
        # Step 2: Series Reduction
        for all nodes n in graph (except source and target):
            if degree(n) == 2:
                u, v = neighbors of n
                R1 = resistance between u and n
                R2 = resistance between n and v
                remove node n and edges (u, n), (n, v)
                add new edge (u, v) with resistance R1 + R2
                update graph
    
    if there is exactly one edge between source and target:
        return resistance of that edge
    else:
        return "Graph cannot be fully simplified with series/parallel reductions alone."
```

### Explanation of Handling Nested Combinations
The algorithm handles nested combinations by iteratively simplifying the graph from the innermost components outward. For example:
1. In a nested series-parallel circuit, the innermost parallel or series group is reduced first, which then exposes the next layer for simplification.
2. The loop continues until no further reductions are possible.

### Example Inputs and Handling

#### Example 1: Simple Series Circuit
- Graph: $A \)-[R1]-\( B \)-[R2]-\( C$
- Steps:
  1. Node $B$ has degree 2 (series connection).
  2. Replace $R1$ and $R2$ with $R_{eq} = R1 + R2$ between $A$ and $C$.
- Result: $R_{eq} = R1 + R2$.

#### Example 2: Simple Parallel Circuit
- Graph: $A$-[R1]-$B$, $A$-[R2]-$B$
- Steps:
  1. Two parallel edges between $A$ and $B$.
  2. Replace with $R_{eq} = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{R1} + \frac{1}{R2}}$.
- Result: $R_{eq} = \frac{R1 R2}{R1 + R2}$.

#### Example 3: Nested Combination
- Graph: $A$-[R1]-$B$-[R2]-$C$, $A$-[R3]-$C$
- Steps:
  1. First, reduce the series $R1$ and $R2$ between $A$ and $C$ to $R_{series} = R1 + R2$.
  2. Now, $R_{series}$ and $R3$ are in parallel between $A$ and $C$.
  3. Replace with $R_{eq} = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{R1 + R2} + \frac{1}{R3}}$.
- Result: $R_{eq} = \frac{(R1 + R2) R3}{R1 + R2 + R3}$.

### Efficiency and Potential Improvements
- **Efficiency**: The algorithm is efficient for circuits reducible to series/parallel combinations (polynomial time). However, it may fail for non-series-parallel circuits (e.g., Wheatstone bridge).
- **Improvements**:
  1. Use a priority queue to identify reducible nodes/edges faster.
  2. For non-series-parallel circuits, use matrix methods (e.g., Laplacian matrix with Kirchhoff's laws).
  3. Implement graph traversal (DFS/BFS) to detect reducible subgraphs.

This approach provides a structured way to compute equivalent resistance using graph theory, handling nested combinations through iterative simplification. For full implementation, libraries like `networkx` (Python) can be used for graph manipulation.
