Theoretical Foundation Projectile motion describes the motion of an object launched into the air, influenced only by gravitational acceleration. Let\u2019s derive the fundamental equations governing this motion.

Discussion"},{"location":"1%20Physics/1%20Mechanics/Problem_2/","text":"Problem 2 Investigating the Dynamics of a Forced Damped Pendulum 1. Theoretical Foundation The forced damped pendulum is governed by the differential equation: \\[ \\frac{d^2\\theta}{dt^2} + b\\frac{d\\theta}{dt} + \\frac{g}{L}\\sin\\theta = A\\cos(\\omega t) \\] where: - \\(\\theta\\) = angular displacement - \\(b\\) = damping coefficient - \\(g\\) = gravitational acceleration - \\(L\\) = length of the pendulum - \\(A\\) = amplitude of the external driving force - \\(\\omega\\) = frequency of the external driving force - \\(t\\) = time For small angles ( \\(\\theta \\approx \\sin\\theta\\) ), the equation simplifies to: \\(\\frac{d^2\\theta}{dt^2} + b\\frac{d\\theta}{dt} + \\frac{g}{L}\\theta = A\\cos(\\omega t)\\) The general solution of this equation involves both homogeneous (natural) and particular (forced) solutions. The system exhibits resonance when the driving frequency \\(\\omega\\) matches the system's natural frequency \\(\\sqrt{g/L}\\) . 2. Analysis of Dynamics Key parameters influencing the system\u2019s behavior: - Damping coefficient (b): Controls energy dissipation; high values lead to overdamping and slow returns to equilibrium, while low values result in underdamping and oscillations. - Driving amplitude (A): Determines the intensity of the external force; larger amplitudes lead to more significant displacement and potential chaotic motion. - Driving frequency ( \\(\\omega\\) ): Controls the rate of external driving; resonance occurs when \\(\\omega \\approx \\sqrt{g/L}\\) . As the parameters change, the system transitions from: - Periodic oscillations: Regular and predictable motion. - Quasiperiodic behavior: Motion with two incommensurate frequencies. - Chaotic motion: Sensitive dependence on initial conditions, leading to unpredictable outcomes. 3. Practical Applications Energy harvesting: Devices capturing mechanical energy from oscillations. Suspension bridges: Avoiding resonance-induced destructive oscillations.
